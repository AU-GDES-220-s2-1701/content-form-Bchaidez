  <h2 class="center-me">Fighting Style</h2>

	  <p>Upholding the premise that most of the advantage of a larger, stronger
	    opponent comes from superior reach and more powerful strikes, both of which
	    are mitigated when grappling on the ground, Brazilian jiu-jitsu emphasizes
	    getting an opponent to the ground in order to use ground fighting techniques
	    and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds. A more precise
	    way of describing this would be to say that on the ground, physical strength
	    can be offset or enhanced by an experienced grappler who knows how to maximize
	    force using mechanical advantage instead of pure physical strength.</p>
	  <p>BJJ permits a wide variety of techniques to take the fight to the ground
	    after taking a grip. While other combat sports, such as Judo and Wrestling
	    almost always use a takedown to bring an opponent to the ground, in BJJ one
	    option is to "pull guard." This entails obtaining some grip on the opponent
	    and then bringing the fight or match onto the mat by sitting straight down
	    or by jumping and wrapping the legs around the opponent.</p>
	  <p>Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers)
	    are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the
	    application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the
	    ground is one of the hallmarks of the BJJ style, and includes effective use
	    of the guard (a signature position of BJJ) position to defend oneself from
	    bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility
	    of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the
	    guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount, and back mount
	    positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a
	    form of kinetic chess when used by two experienced practitioners. A submission
	    hold is the equivalent of checkmate in the sport, reflecting a disadvantage
	    which would be extremely difficult to overcome in a fight (such as a dislocated
	    joint or unconsciousness).</p>
	  <p>Renzo Gracie wrote in his book Mastering Jiu-jitsu:</p>
	    <blockquote>
	      <i>The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to
	      guide a combatant over the course of a fight. Indeed, this was one of Kano's
	      most fundamental and perceptive criticisms of the classical program.'
	      Maeda not only taught the art of judo to Carlos Gracie, but also taught a
	      particular philosophy about the nature of combat developed by Kano, and
	      further refined by Maeda based on his worldwide travels competing against
	      fighters skilled in a wide variety of martial arts.</i>

<h2>Ground Fighting</h2>
  <p>BJJ is most strongly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater
    emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based styles spend almost no
    time on groundwork. Even other grappling martial arts tend to spend much more
    time on the standing phase. It is helpful to contrast its rules with kodokan
    judo's greater emphasis on throws, due to both its radically different point-scoring
    system, and the absence of most of the judo rules that cause the competitors
    to have to recommence in a standing position. This has led to greater time
    dedicated to training on the ground similar to that of Kosen Judo, resulting
    in enhancement and new research of groundwork techniques by BJJ practitioners.</p>
  <p>Along with BJJ's strengths on the ground comes its relative underemphasis of
    standing techniques, such as striking. To remedy this comparative lack, there
    is an emphasis on take-downs and cross-training between BJJ, wrestling, judo,
    and sambo, as well as striking based arts such as boxing, karate, taekwondo,
    Muay Thai, and kickboxing.</p>

<h2>Primary Ground Positions</h2>

<div class="row">
							<div class="pic-left"> <img src="img/fullmount.png" alt="Full Mount"> </div>

			<h3>Full Mount</h3>
				<div class="indent-right">
				<p>In the mount position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's chest,
					controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form
					of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's arm pits
					to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter the submission attempts.
					Full Mount can be used to apply armlocks or chokes.</p>
				</div>
</div>


<div class="row clearfix">
		<h3>Side Control</h3>
	<div class="pic-right"> <img src="img/sidecontrol.jpg" alt="Side Control"> </div>
				<p indent-left>In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the
		    side of his body. The dominant grappler lies across the opponent with weight
		    applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by
		    pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's
		    elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions are initiated
		    from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally,
		    the typical side mount increases opportunity for the dominant grappler to
		    advance to a more dominant and less used type of side control known as the
		    mounted crucifix position. In this position, the dominant grappler has his
		    body at the very top of the opponent's torso, one arm controlled between both
		    of the top grappler's arms, and the other arm trapped between the legs. This
		    position is most used in MMA as it allows the dominant fighter to strike whilst
		    taking away their opponents defence. Submission options are limited however and
		    so this position is rarely used in BJJ competition. Variants of the side control
		    include Twister Side Control (popularized by Eddie Bravo), Brazilian Crossbody,
		    Kesa Gatame, "Wrestler Pin" and knee mount.</p>
</div>


<div class="row clearfix">
	<div class="pic-left"> <img class="backmount" src="img/backmount.jpg" alt="Back Mount"></div>
		<div class="indent-right">
		  <h3>Back Mount</h3>
			  <p>When using the back mount (often known in Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the back
			    grab or attacking the back), the practitioner attaches to the back of the
			    opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with
			    his heels[30] or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the
			    waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep
			    as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled
			    by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position
			    is often used to apply chokeholds, and counters much of the benefit an opponent
			    may have from greater size or strength.</p>
				</div>
	</div>

<div class="row clearfix">
			<h3> Guards </h3>
			<p>In the Guard, the practitioner is on his back controlling an opponent with his legs.
				The practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to upset the balance and limit
				the movements of his opponent. This position comes into play often when an opponent
				manages to place the practitioner upon his back and the practitioner seeks
				the best position possible to launch counter-attacks. This is a very versatile
				position from which the BJJ practitioner can attempt to sweep (reverse)
				the opponent, get back to the feet, or apply a variety of joint locks as
				well as various chokes.</p>
			<p>The three main types of guard are Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.</p>
			<p>In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's
				trunk, and ankles closed together to provide control and a barrier to
				 escaping the position. The closed guard is a very powerful guard seen
				 often in MMA style tournaments because of amount of control it gives the
				 bottom fighter and lack of necessity for grips to control top opponent
				 and block his strikes. This guard allow many setups for submissions such
				 as jointlocks and chokes as well as great opportunities for reversing the
				 opponent into the very dominant fully mounted position.</p>
			<p>In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler
					uses his legs or feet to push or pull in a more dynamic fashion. There are
					many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including
					the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Spider Guard, Lapel Guard,
					and even the newly emerging Worm Guard made popular by Keenan Cornelius.
					Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet
					together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from
					the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to
					maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the
					feet against the competitor's inner thighs.</p>
			<p>In the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the
				bottom grappler's legs, blocking the top opponent from achieving the side
				control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of Half-Guard
				called 50/50 Guard, which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions
				with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored
				fashion. This position is called 50/50, because neither opponent has a distinct
				advantage with both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
			<h2 class="center-me"> Submissions </h2>
				<p>The majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories:
					joint locks and chokes. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's
					limb and creating a lever with the body position which will force the joint
					to move past its normal range of motion. Pressure is increased in a
					controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and
					signals defeat by submitting. Opponents can indicate submission verbally or
					they can "tap out" by tapping the opponent or the mat. (Tapping one's own
					body is dangerous because the opponent may not be able to tell if his or her
					opponent is tapping.) A choke hold, by disrupting the blood supply to the
					brain, can cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not submit soon enough.</p>
				<p>A less common type of submission hold is a compression lock, where the
					muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly
					the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of
					locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing
					muscle tissue. This type of lock often also hyper-extends the joint in the
					opposite direction, pulling it apart.</p>
</div>

<div class="row clearfix">
			<h3> Joint Locks </h3>
				<p>While many joint locks are permitted, most competitions ban or restrict
					some or all joint locks involving the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason
					for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly
					the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a
					twisting motion of the knee (called twisting knee locks or twisting knee bars,
					or techniques such as heel hooks, and toe holds) are usually banned in competitions
					because successfully completing the move nearly always results in permanent
					damage that requires surgery. Similarly, joint manipulations of the spine are
					typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or mis-aligning cervical
					vertebrae. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level,
					with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight
					ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the banana split at white
					through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions
					being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow heel
					hooks, which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous to competitors.</p>
					<div class="pic-right"> <img class="jointlock" src="img/jointlock.jpg" alt="Joint Lock"> </div>
					<div class="indent-left">
				<p>However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are
					permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those
					locks are safe to use under tournament conditions. Joint locks include Armbars,
					Kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, Omoplata, and other shoulder locks.
					Also, some fighters practice moves whose sole purpose is to inflict pain upon
					their opponent, in the hope that they will tap out. This includes driving
					knuckles into pressure points, holding their opponent's head in order to tire
					out the neck (called the "can opener" or kubi-hishigi) and putting body weight
					on top of the sternum, floating ribs, or similarly sensitive bones. These moves
					are not true submission moves; they are generally only used as distractions
					mostly in lower levels of competition. They are avoided or aggressively countered
					in middle to upper levels of competition.</p>

<div class="pic-left"> <img class="choke" src="img/choke.jpg" alt="Chokes and Strangles"></div>
		<div class="indent-right">
			<h3>Chokes and Strangles</h3>
					<p>Chokes and strangles (commonly referred to as "air chokes" and "blood chokes")
						are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure
						on the carotid arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve baroreceptors
						in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with
						victims typically losing consciousness in around 3–5 seconds. In contrast, an
						air choke (involving constriction of the windpipe) can take up to two minutes,
						depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious
						damage to the throat.</p>
