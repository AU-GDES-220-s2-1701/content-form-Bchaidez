      <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>Brazillian Jiu Jitsu is one of the safest martial arts. However, it is
          very effective as a fighter could quickly dislocate their opponents
          joints or knock them out with a choke-hold if they choose to. The injury
          rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than in
          Mixed martial arts (236-286 per 1000), boxing (210-420 per 1000), judo (
          25.3-130.6) and Taekwondo (20.5-139.5). It is similar to wrestling which also
          uses grappling instead of striking; the few injuries that may be incurred in
          Brazillian Jiu Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head.</p>
      <h3>Skin Health</h3>
        <p>Besides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts,
          Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other
          grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary
          mat conditions. They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.
          Several commonly contracted skin diseases include ringworm, impetigo,
          herpes gladiatorum, and staph infection. Proper hygiene practices,
          including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after
          class with soap, disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning
          of any gi/rashguard/headgear used before the next class, not sharing used t
          owels/uniforms, and using a barrier cream greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.</p>

		  <h3>Cauliflower Ear</h3>
			<div class="pic-left"> <img src="img/cauliflowerear.png" alt="Cauliflower Ear"> </div>
        <p class="ear">Due to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in jiu-jitsu,
          the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell. Without immediate medical
          treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the perichondrium
          that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed
          (cauliflower ear). The use of wrestling headgear is sometimes used for prevention of this condition.</p>

			<h3>Performance-enhancing Drugs</h3>
        <p>The practice of taking performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids,
          is believed to be relatively commonplace in sport jiu-jitsu tournaments and has
          sparked letters and public statements by some of jiu-jitsu's top competitors,
          including Comprido and Caio Terra, regarding the matter. In response, the
          IBJJF began testing for performance-enhancing drugs at IBJJF sponsored events,
          starting with the 2013 Pan American Championship.</p>
					</div>
      <h3>Cervical and Spinal Lock "Neck Cranks"</h3>
        <p>A spinal lock is a multiple joint lock applied to the spinal column, which
          is performed by forcing the spine beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is
          typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions.
          Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal
          sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe
          ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord
          injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks are completely forbidden from G
          i Jiu Jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of No Gi Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts.
          Due to its illegal nature and express purpose to cause serious, irrevocable bodily
          injury, paralysis, and death, its use both inside and outside of the gym can constitute aggravated assault.</p>
