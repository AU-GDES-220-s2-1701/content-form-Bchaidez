  <h2 class="center-me">Uniform</h2>

    <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner's uniform is similar to a judogi, but
       often with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner
       to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate,
       although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully
       selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be promoted
       in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the wearing of the jiu-jitsugi while training is a requirement.
       Recently with the growing popularity of "no gi" Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the practice of
       giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., Rolles Gracie awarding Rashad Evans a
       black belt) has become more common. The term kimono is sometimes used to describe the
       outfit, especially in Brazil.</p>
  <h2 class="center-me">Ranks</h2>

    <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored
      belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill.
      While the system's structure shares its origins with the judo ranking system and
      the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects
      and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division
      between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct
      and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional
      criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a
      conservative approach to promotion in general.</p>
		</div>
    <p>Traditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and
      earned route of promotion holds true. Some schools have placed a green belt
      for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between
      advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's
      programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.</p>
    <p>Unlike in some martial arts such as judo and karate, a black belt in Brazilian
      jiu-jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally
      considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt
      varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds
      in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through
       any intermediate rank.[35] Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.
      Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a
      consistent training schedule.[37] However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders
      Hélio and Carlos Gracie) has stated that the average of 10–12 years is longer than necessary,
      suggesting that the ego of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to
      black belt should take 7 years.</p>
