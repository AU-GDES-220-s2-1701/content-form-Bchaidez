	<h2>Tournaments</h2>

		<p>While there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by
			 private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in the jiu-jitsu
			 sub culture. First, is the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF), a
			 (nonprofit) organization with federations and tournaments all around the globe.
			 Second, is the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), an organization
			 that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the Pan American
			 Championship, European Championship, and the Mundials. California, New York, and
			 Texas are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently. Other
			 promotions within North America, such as American Grappling Federation (AGF), North
			 American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and North American Grappling Association (NAGA) host
			 tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.</p>
		<p>Another tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals
			or Gracie Worlds. Started by Rose Gracie, daughter of Ultimate Fighting Championship creator
			and Brazilian jiu-jitsu grandmaster Rorion Gracie. Founded in 2007, Gracie Nationals/Worlds
			mimicked other respected tournaments at the time, implementing a points system to score victories.</p>
		<p>In 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing subjective
			judging opinions and what many see as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke candidly
			about this change when she said, "Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio
			Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of jiu-jitsu.
			We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need
			to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution." Cheating
			in jiu-jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. "[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold
			for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,"
			Rose said. "That's not jiu-jitsu. That's cheating."</p>
		<p>This discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout
			the jiu-jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. The winner
			of a match is determined only by submission. Tournament format can have no time limit, or be
			timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This tournament
			style has yet to establish itself as something that the general competitor field demands, but
			it is slowly gaining popularity. Metamoris, a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother
			Ralek Gracie, has helped push this niche into a bit more prominence. Another notable example of
			a submission-only format is the EBI (Eddie Bravo Invitational), which was the first televised
			event of its kind, and is now being featured on UFC Fight Pass. Other submission-only events
			have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro and many others.</p>
