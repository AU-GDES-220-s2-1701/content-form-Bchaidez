		<h2> HISTORY </h2>
				<p> Geo Omori opened the first jiu-jitsu / judo school in Brazil in 1909.
					He would go on to teach a number of individuals including Luiz França. Later,
					Mitsuyo Maeda was one of five of the Kodokan's top groundwork (newaza) experts
					that judo's founder Kano Jigoro sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art
					to the world. Maeda had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest
					generated by stories about the success of Kodokan Judo at contests with other jujutsu
					schools that were occurring at the time, became a student of Jigoro Kano Maeda left
					Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries giving "jiu-do" demonstrations
					and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters and various other
					martial artists before eventually arriving in Brazil on November 14, 1914.

				<p> Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916,
					Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.
					In 1917 Carlos Gracie, the eldest son of Gastão Gracie, watched a demonstration by
					 Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn judo. Maeda accepted Carlos as a
					 student and Carlos learned for a few years, eventually passing his knowledge on to
					 his brothers. Sibling Hélio Gracie gradually further developed Gracie Jiu Jitsu as
					  a softer, pragmatic adaptation from judo that focused on ground fighting, as he was
						unable to perform many judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength
					</p>

			 <p> Although the Gracie family is typically synonymous with BJJ, another prominent
						lineage started from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, Luiz França. This
						lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students were
						famous for influential use of footlocks and the lineage still survives through Fadda's
						links with today's teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team.

		<h2> Name </h2>
				<p>"Jiu-Jitsu" is an older romanization that was the original spelling of the art in the West,
					and it is still in common use, whereas the modern Hepburn romanization is "jūjutsu".
			    When Maeda left Japan, judo was still often referred to as "Kano jiu-jitsu", or, even
			 	 more generically, simply as jiu-jitsu.[16][17] Higashi, the co-author of "Kano Jiu-Jitsu"
				 wrote in the foreword:</p>
					 <blockquote>
						 Some confusion has arisen over the employment of the term 'jiudo'. To make the matter
						 clear I will state that jiudo is the term selected by Professor Kano as describing his
						 system more accurately than jiu-jitsu does. Professor Kano is one of the leading educators
						 of Japan, and it is natural that he should cast about for the technical word that would most
						 accurately describe his system. But the Japanese people generally still cling to the more
						 popular nomenclature and call it jiu-jitsu.
					 </blockquote>
				 <p>Outside Japan, however, this distinction was noted even less. Thus, when Maeda and Satake
					 arrived in Brazil in 1914, every newspaper announced their art as being "jiu-jitsu" despite
					 both men being Kodokan judoka.</p>
					<p>It was not until 1925 that the Japanese government itself officially mandated that the
						correct name for the martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be "judo"
						rather than "jujutsu".[18] In Brazil, the art is still called "jiu-jitsu". When the Gracies
						went to the United States to spread their art, they used the terms "Brazilian jiu-jitsu"
						and "Gracie Jiu-Jitsu" to differentiate from the already present styles using similar-sounding
						names. In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, Hélio Gracie said, that he didn´t even know
						the word of judo itself, until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that
						Mitsuyo Maeda called his style "jiu-jitsu".</p>
					<p>The art is sometimes referred to as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu (GJJ), this name was trademarked by
						Rorion Gracie, but after a legal dispute with his cousin Carley Gracie, his trademark to the
						name was voided.[19] Other members of the Gracie family often call their style by personalized
						names, such as Charles Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and similarly, the Machado
						family call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ). While each style and its instructors have their
						own unique aspects, they are all basic variations of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Today there are four major
						branches of BJJ from Brazil: Gracie Humaita, Gracie Barra, Carlson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Alliance
						Jiu Jitsu. Each branch can trace its roots back to Mitsuyo Maeda via the Gracie family or Oswaldo Fadda.</p>
